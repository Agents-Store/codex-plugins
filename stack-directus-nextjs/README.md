# stack-directus-nextjs (Codex plugin)

Directus + Next.js architecture plugin. How Directus (content, files, access) and a Next.js App Router frontend fit together: who holds the token, how the cache is invalidated, how assets and types cross the boundary, who owns the session, and a production checklist. Tool knowledge comes from its dependencies.

## Install

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add agents-store/stack-directus-nextjs-codex
```

Or for local development:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add .
```

## Components

- 6 skill(s) under `skills/`
- 1 subagent definition(s) under `agents/` — **not installed automatically by Codex**. Copy manually:

cp agents/*.toml <repo>/.codex/agents/    # project-local
```

- MCP server config pointed to from the manifest (`.mcp.json`) — see AGENTS.md for the `~/.codex/config.toml` snippet
