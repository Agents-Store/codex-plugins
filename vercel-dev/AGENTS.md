## Workflows (canonical slash commands)

Codex CLI doesn't support custom slash commands — invoke these workflows via natural language. Each entry below is a prompt template you can adapt:

### `_conventions`



<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Command Conventions

Every slash command in this plugin follows a consistent structure so that the AI agent produces reliable, verifiable results. When authoring or updating a command file, include **all** of the sections below.

## Required Sections

### 1. Preflight

Check prerequisites before doing any work:

- **Project linked?** — Verify `.vercel/project.json` exists. If not, guide the user through `vercel link`.
- **CLI available?** — Confirm `vercel` CLI is on PATH.
- **Repo state** — Note uncommitted changes, dirty working tree, or detached HEAD when relevant.
- **Scope** — Detect monorepo (e.g., `turbo.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and confirm which package is targeted.

Preflight failures should produce clear, actionable guidance — never silently skip.

### 2. Plan

Before executing, state what will happen:

- List the commands or MCP calls that will run.
- Flag destructive or production-impacting operations and require explicit user confirmation.
- If multiple strategies exist (MCP-first vs CLI-fallback), state which path was chosen and why.

### 3. Commands

The operational core. Follow these conventions:

- **MCP-first, CLI-fallback** — Prefer the Vercel MCP server for reads; use CLI for writes or when MCP lacks coverage.
- **Structured output** — Request `--format=json` where available; parse and present results in a readable summary.
- **No secrets in output** — Never echo environment variable values. Show names and metadata only.
- **Confirmation for destructive ops** — Production deploys, env removal, cache purge, and domain changes require an explicit "yes" from the user.

### 4. Verification

After execution, confirm the outcome:

- Re-read state (e.g., `vercel ls`, `vercel env ls`) to confirm the operation took effect.
- Compare before/after where possible (e.g., deployment count, env var count).
- Surface errors or warnings from command output.

### 5. Summary

Present a concise result block:

```
## Result
- **Action**: what was done
- **Status**: success | partial | failed
- **Details**: key output (URL, counts, config changes)
```

### 6. Next Steps

Suggest logical follow-ups:

- After deploy → check logs, inspect build, verify preview URL.
- After env change → pull to local, redeploy if production.
- After status → fix any flagged issues, run deploy if stale.

## File Naming

- Command files live in `commands/` and end in `.md`.
- Files prefixed with `_` (like this one) are meta-documents, not slash commands. They are excluded from `plugin.json` enumeration and not presented as user-invocable commands.

## Frontmatter

Every command file must include YAML frontmatter with at least a `description` field:

```yaml
---
description: One-line summary of what the command does.
---
```

## Validation

`scripts/validate.ts` enforces these conventions. Every non-underscore command file is checked for the required sections: Preflight, Plan, Commands, Verification, Summary, Next Steps.

</details>

### `bootstrap`

Bootstrap a repository with Vercel-linked resources by running preflight checks, provisioning integrations, verifying env keys, and then executing db/dev startup commands safely.

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Vercel Project Bootstrap

Run a deterministic bootstrap flow for new or partially configured repositories.

## Preflight

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Preflight -->
1. Confirm Vercel CLI is installed and authenticated.

```bash
vercel --version
vercel whoami
```

2. Confirm repo linkage by checking `.vercel/project.json`.
3. If not linked, inspect available teams/projects before asking the user to choose:

```bash
vercel teams ls
vercel projects ls --scope <team>
vercel link --yes --scope <team> --project <project>
```

4. Find the env template in priority order: `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, `.env.template`.
5. Create local env file if missing:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

6. Detect package manager and available scripts (`db:push`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate`, `db:generate`, `dev`) from `package.json`.
7. Inspect auth/database signals (`prisma/schema.prisma`, `drizzle.config.*`, `auth.*`, `src/**/auth.*`) to scope bootstrap details.

Stop with clear guidance if CLI auth or linkage fails.

## Plan

Execute in this order:

1. Preflight validation and project linking.
2. Resource provisioning (prefer Vercel-managed Neon integration).
3. Secret/bootstrap env setup (`AUTH_SECRET`, env pull, key verification).
4. Application bootstrap (`db:*` then `dev`) only after env checks pass.

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Rules -->
- Do not run `db:push`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, or `dev` until Vercel linking is complete and env keys are verified.
- Prefer Vercel-managed provisioning (`vercel integration ...`) for shared resources.
- Use provider CLIs only as fallback when Vercel integration flow is unavailable.
- Never echo secret values in terminal output, logs, or summaries.

## Commands

### 1. Link + local env template

Copy the first matching template file only if `.env.local` does not exist:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

If `.env.example` is absent, use `.env.sample` or `.env.template`.

### 2. Provision Postgres

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Resource Setup: Postgres -->
### Preferred path (Vercel-managed Neon)

1. Read integration setup guidance:

```bash
vercel integration guide neon
```

2. Add Neon integration to the Vercel scope:

```bash
vercel integration add neon --scope <team>
```

3. Verify expected environment variable names exist in Vercel and pull locally:

```bash
vercel env ls
vercel env pull .env.local --yes
```

### Fallback path 1 (Dashboard)

1. Provision Neon through the Vercel dashboard integration UI.
2. Re-run `vercel env pull .env.local --yes`.

### Fallback path 2 (Neon CLI)

Use Neon CLI only when Vercel-managed provisioning is unavailable. After creating resources, add required env vars in Vercel and pull again.

### 3. Generate and store `AUTH_SECRET`

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: AUTH_SECRET Generation -->
Generate a high-entropy secret without printing it, then store it in Vercel and refresh local env:

```bash
AUTH_SECRET="$(node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))")"
printf "%s" "$AUTH_SECRET" | vercel env add AUTH_SECRET development preview production
unset AUTH_SECRET
vercel env pull .env.local --yes
```

### 4. Verify required env keys

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Env Verification -->
Compare required keys from template file against `.env.local` keys (names only, never values):

```bash
template_file=""
for candidate in .env.example .env.sample .env.template; do
  if [ -f "$candidate" ]; then
    template_file="$candidate"
    break
  fi
done

comm -23 \
  <(grep -E '^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=' "$template_file" | cut -d '=' -f 1 | sort -u) \
  <(grep -E '^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=' .env.local | cut -d '=' -f 1 | sort -u)
```

Proceed only when missing key list is empty.

Do not continue if any required keys are missing.

### 5. Run app bootstrap commands (after verification)

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: App Setup -->
After linkage + env verification:

```bash
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Use the repository package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or `yarn`) and run only scripts that exist in `package.json`.

## Verification

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Bootstrap Verification -->
Confirm each checkpoint:

- `vercel whoami` succeeds.
- `.vercel/project.json` exists and matches chosen project.
- Postgres integration path completed (Vercel integration, dashboard, or provider CLI fallback).
- `vercel env pull .env.local --yes` succeeds.
- Required env key diff is empty.
- Database command status is recorded (`db:push`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate`, `db:generate` as applicable).
- `dev` command starts without immediate config/auth/env failure.

If verification fails, stop and report exact failing step plus remediation.

## Summary

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Summary Format -->
Return a final bootstrap summary in this format:

```md
## Bootstrap Result
- **Linked Project**: <team>/<project>
- **Resource Path**: vercel-integration-neon | dashboard-neon | neon-cli
- **Env Keys**: <count> required, <count> present, <count> missing
- **Secrets**: AUTH_SECRET set in Vercel (value never shown)
- **Migration Status**: not-run | success | failed (<step>)
- **Dev Result**: not-run | started | failed
```

## Next Steps

<!-- Sourced from bootstrap skill: Bootstrap Next Steps -->
- If env keys are still missing, add the missing keys in Vercel and re-run `vercel env pull .env.local --yes`.
- If DB commands fail, fix connectivity/schema issues and re-run only the failed db step.
- If `dev` fails, resolve runtime errors, then restart with your package manager's `run dev`.

</details>

### `deploy`

Deploy the current project to Vercel. Pass "prod" or "production" as argument to deploy to production. Default is to ask the user which target (production or preview).

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Deploy to Vercel

Deploy the current project to Vercel using the CLI, with preflight safety checks, explicit production confirmation, and post-deploy verification.

## Preflight

Run these checks before any deployment. Stop on failure and print actionable guidance.

1. **CLI available?** — Confirm `vercel` is on PATH.
   - If missing: `npm i -g vercel` (or `pnpm add -g vercel` / `bun add -g vercel`).
2. **Project linked?** — Check for `.vercel/project.json` in the current directory or nearest parent.
   - If not found: run `vercel link` interactively, then re-run `/deploy`.
3. **Monorepo detection** — Look for `turbo.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at the repo root.
   - If detected: confirm which package is targeted. If ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.
4. **Uncommitted changes** — Run `git status --porcelain`.
   - If output is non-empty: warn the user that uncommitted changes will **not** be included in the deploy. Ask whether to continue or commit first.
   - If not a git repo, skip this check.
5. **VERCEL_TOKEN conflict?** — Check if `VERCEL_TOKEN` is set in the environment (`echo $VERCEL_TOKEN`).
   - If set: it overrides CLI interactive login and may cause auth failures (e.g., token from Infisical/CI that doesn't match the CLI-authenticated account). Run `unset VERCEL_TOKEN` before all `vercel` CLI commands in this session, or prefix each command with `unset VERCEL_TOKEN &&`.
6. **Framework detection (Next.js)?** — If the project has a `next.config.ts` or `next.config.js` but **no `vercel.json`** with a `"framework"` field:
   - Create `vercel.json` with `{"$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json", "framework": "nextjs"}`.
   - **Why:** Without this, CLI-only deploys (no Git integration) may use a generic builder. The build appears to succeed, but all routes return 404 because Vercel doesn't generate the correct routing configuration. This is the #1 cause of "build succeeds but site shows 404".
7. **`output: 'standalone'` in Next.js config?** — Check `next.config.ts` / `next.config.js` for `output: 'standalone'`.
   - If found: warn that `standalone` output is for Docker/self-hosting and is incompatible with Vercel. Suggest conditionally disabling it:
     ```typescript
     ...(process.env.VERCEL ? {} : { output: 'standalone' as const }),
     ```
   - Ask the user before modifying the config.
8. **Git author email vs Vercel team (Hobby plan)?** — If `.vercel/project.json` exists and contains an `orgId` starting with `team_`:
   - Run `vercel teams ls` and `git log -1 --format='%ae'` to check if the git author email matches the team owner.
   - On Hobby plans, only the team owner can deploy. If emails don't match, warn the user and suggest: `git config user.email "<team-owner-email>"` followed by an empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: update deploy author"`).
9. **Env vars for preview?** — If deploying a preview and the project has no Git integration (`vercel.json` has no `github` config or project was linked without Git):
   - Preview env vars may not be configured. Check `vercel env ls` for Preview entries.
   - If missing: pass env vars directly via `-b` (build-time) and `-e` (runtime) flags:
     ```bash
     vercel deploy -b KEY="value" -e KEY="value"
     ```
   - Read required vars from `.env.local` or `.env.example`.
10. **Observability preflight** (production deploys only) —

Before promoting to production, verify observability readiness:

- **Drains check**: Query configured drains via MCP `list_drains` or REST API. If no drains are configured on a Pro/Enterprise plan, warn:
  > ⚠️ No drains configured. Production errors won't be forwarded to external monitoring.
  > Configure drains via Dashboard or REST API before promoting.
- **Errored drains**: If any drain is in error state, warn and suggest remediation before deploying:
  > ⚠️ Drain "<url>" is errored. Fix or recreate before production deploy to avoid monitoring gaps.
- **Error monitoring**: Check that at least one of these is in place: configured drains, an error tracking integration (e.g., Sentry, Datadog via `vercel integration ls`), or `@vercel/analytics` in the project.
- These are warnings, not blockers — the user may proceed after acknowledgment.

## Plan

State the intended action before executing:

- **Preview deploy**: `vercel` — creates a preview deployment on a unique URL.
- **Production deploy**: `vercel --prod` — deploys to production domains.

If "$ARGUMENTS" contains "prod" or "production":

> ⚠️ **Production deployment requested.**
> This will deploy to your live production URL and affect real users.
> **Ask the user for explicit confirmation before proceeding.** Do not deploy to production without a clear "yes."

If "$ARGUMENTS" is empty (no target specified):

> **Ask the user before proceeding:** "Deploy to **production** or **preview**?"
> Do not assume a default — the user must explicitly choose the deployment target. Deploying to the wrong target wastes build minutes and causes confusion (e.g., preview deployments may lack required env vars).

If "$ARGUMENTS" contains "preview":

> Deploying a **preview** build. This creates an isolated URL and does not affect production.

## Commands

### Preview Deployment

<!-- Sourced from deployments-cicd skill: Deployment Commands > Preview Deployment -->
```bash
# Deploy from project root (creates preview URL)
vercel

# Equivalent explicit form
vercel deploy
```

Preview deployments are created automatically for every push to a non-production branch when using Git integration. They provide a unique URL for testing.

### Production Deployment (requires confirmation)

<!-- Sourced from deployments-cicd skill: Deployment Commands > Production Deployment -->
```bash
# Deploy directly to production
vercel --prod
vercel deploy --prod

# Force a new deployment (skip cache)
vercel --prod --force
```

Capture the full command output. Extract the **deployment URL** from the output (the line containing the `.vercel.app` URL or custom domain URL).

Record the current git commit SHA for the summary:

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
```

## Verification

After deployment completes, verify the result:

### 1. Inspect the Deployment

<!-- Sourced from deployments-cicd skill: Deployment Commands > Inspect Deployments -->
```bash
# View deployment details (build info, functions, metadata)
vercel inspect <deployment-url>

# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# View logs for a deployment
vercel logs <deployment-url>
vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow
```

Extract: deployment state (READY / ERROR / QUEUED / BUILDING), build duration, framework, Node.js version, function count.

### 2. On Failure — Fetch Build Logs

If the deployment state is **ERROR** or the deploy command exited non-zero:

```bash
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

Present the last 50 lines of build logs to help diagnose the failure. Highlight any lines containing `error`, `Error`, `ERR!`, or `FATAL`.

### 3. On Success — Quick Smoke Check

If the deployment state is **READY**, note the URL is live and accessible.

### 4. Post-Deploy Error Scan (production deploys)

For production deployments, wait 60 seconds after READY state, then scan for early runtime errors:

```bash
vercel logs <deployment-url> --level error --since 1h
```

Or via MCP if available: use `get_runtime_logs` with level filter `error`.

**Interpret results:**

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No errors | ✓ Clean deploy — no runtime errors in first hour |
| Errors detected | List error count and first 5 unique error messages. Suggest: check drain payloads for correlated traces, review function logs in Dashboard |
| 500 status codes in logs | Correlate timestamps with drain data (if configured) or `vercel logs <url> --json` for structured output. Flag for immediate investigation |
| Timeout errors | Check function duration limits in `vercel.json` or project settings. Consider increasing `maxDuration` |

**Fallback (no drains):**

If no drains are configured, the error scan relies on CLI and Dashboard:

```bash
# Stream live errors
vercel logs <deployment-url> --level error --follow

# JSON output for parsing
vercel logs <deployment-url> --level error --since 1h --json
```

> For richer post-deploy monitoring, configure drains to forward logs/traces to an external platform via Dashboard or REST API.

## Summary

<!-- Sourced from deployments-cicd skill: Deploy Summary Format -->
Present a structured deploy result block:

```
## Deploy Result
- **URL**: <deployment-url>
- **Target**: production | preview
- **Status**: READY | ERROR | BUILDING | QUEUED
- **Commit**: <short-sha>
- **Framework**: <detected-framework>
- **Build Duration**: <duration>
```

If the deployment failed, append:

```
- **Error**: <summary of failure from logs>
```

For production deploys, also include:

```
### Post-Deploy Observability
- **Error scan**: <N errors found / clean> (scanned via vercel logs --level error --since 1h)
- **Drains**: <N configured / none>
- **Monitoring**: <active / gaps identified>
```

## Next Steps

<!-- Sourced from deployments-cicd skill: Deploy Next Steps -->
Based on the deployment outcome:

- **Success (preview)** → "Visit the preview URL to verify. When ready, run `/deploy prod` to promote to production."
- **Success (production)** → "Your production site is live. Run `/status` to see the full project overview."
- **Build error** → "Check the build logs above. Common fixes: verify `build` script in package.json, check for missing env vars with `/env list`, ensure dependencies are installed."
- **Missing env vars** → "Run `/env pull` to sync environment variables locally, or `/env list` to review what's configured on Vercel."
- **Monorepo issues** → "Ensure the correct project root is configured in Vercel project settings. Check `vercel.json` for `rootDirectory`."
- **Post-deploy errors detected** → "Review errors above. Check `vercel logs <url> --level error` for details. If drains are configured, correlate with external monitoring."
- **No monitoring configured** → "Set up drains or install an error tracking integration before the next production deploy. Run `/status` for a full observability diagnostic."

</details>

### `env`

Manage Vercel environment variables. Commands include list, pull, add, remove, and diff. Use to sync environment variables between Vercel and your local development environment.

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Vercel Environment Variables

Manage environment variables for the current Vercel project with safety rails to prevent secret leakage.

> **🔒 Never-Echo-Secrets Rule**: Environment variable **values** must never appear in command output, summaries, or conversation text. Only show variable **names**, **environments**, and **metadata** (created date, type). This rule applies to all subcommands.

## Preflight

1. **CLI available?** — Confirm `vercel` is on PATH.
   - If missing: `npm i -g vercel` (or `pnpm add -g vercel` / `bun add -g vercel`).
2. **Project linked?** — Check for `.vercel/project.json` in the current directory or nearest parent.
   - If not found: run `vercel link` interactively, then re-run `/env`.
3. **Detect environment files** — Check for `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production.local`, `.env.development.local` in the project root. Note which exist for the diff subcommand.

## Plan

Based on "$ARGUMENTS", determine the action:

| Argument | Action | Destructive? |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `list` / `ls` / _(none)_ | List env var names per environment | No |
| `pull` | Download env vars to local `.env.local` | No (overwrites local file) |
| `add <NAME>` | Add a new env var | Yes (if production) |
| `rm <NAME>` / `remove <NAME>` | Remove an env var | **Yes** |
| `diff` | Compare local vs Vercel key names | No |

For any operation that mutates **production** environment variables (`add` or `rm` targeting production):

> ⚠️ **Production environment mutation requested.**
> This will change environment variables on your live production deployment.
> **Ask the user for explicit confirmation before proceeding.** Do not mutate production env vars without a clear "yes."

## Commands

### "list" or "ls" or no arguments

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: vercel env CLI > List Environment Variables -->
```bash
# List all environment variables
vercel env ls

# Filter by environment
vercel env ls production
```

Present results as a table of variable **names only** grouped by environment. **Never print values.**

| Name | Production | Preview | Development |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| API_KEY | ✓ | ✓ | — |

### "pull"

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: vercel env CLI > Pull Environment Variables -->
```bash
# Pull all env vars for the current environment into .env.local
vercel env pull .env.local

# Pull for a specific environment
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=preview
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=development

# Overwrite existing file without prompting
vercel env pull .env.local --yes

# Pull to a custom file
vercel env pull .env.production.local --environment=production
```

After pulling, remind the user:

> Ensure `.env*.local` is in your `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

### "add \<NAME\>"

1. Ask the user which environments to target: production, preview, development (can select multiple).
2. If **production** is selected, require explicit confirmation (see Plan section).
3. Run the add command:

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: vercel env CLI > Add Environment Variables -->
```bash
# Interactive — prompts for value and environments
vercel env add MY_SECRET

# Non-interactive
echo "secret-value" | vercel env add MY_SECRET production

# Add to multiple environments
echo "secret-value" | vercel env add MY_SECRET production preview development

# Add a sensitive variable (encrypted, not shown in logs)
vercel env add MY_SECRET --sensitive
```

The CLI will prompt for the value interactively — **do not pass the value as a CLI argument or echo it**.

### "rm \<NAME\>" or "remove \<NAME\>"

1. If the variable exists in **production**, require explicit confirmation.
2. Run the remove command:

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: vercel env CLI > Remove Environment Variables -->
```bash
# Remove from specific environment
vercel env rm MY_SECRET production

# Remove from all environments
vercel env rm MY_SECRET
```

Confirm the target environment(s) with the user before executing.

### "diff"

Compare local environment file key names against Vercel-configured key names. **Only compare names — never read or display values.**

1. Read local env file keys (from `.env.local` or `.env` — whichever exists):

```bash
grep -v '^#' .env.local | grep '=' | cut -d'=' -f1 | sort
```

2. Fetch Vercel env var names:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

Parse the output to extract variable names for the target environment (default: development).

3. Present the diff:

```
## Env Diff — Local vs Vercel (development)

### In local but NOT on Vercel:
- EXTRA_LOCAL_VAR
- DEBUG_MODE

### On Vercel but NOT in local:
- ANALYTICS_KEY
- SENTRY_DSN

### In both:
- DATABASE_URL
- API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
```

If all keys match, report: "Local and Vercel environment keys are in sync."

## Environment-Specific Configuration Reference

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: Environment-Specific Configuration -->
### Vercel Dashboard vs .env Files

| Use Case | Where to Set |
|----------|-------------|
| Secrets (API keys, tokens) | Vercel Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/settings/environment-variables`) or `vercel env add` |
| Public config (site URL, feature flags) | `.env` or `.env.[environment]` files |
| Local-only overrides | `.env.local` |
| CI/CD secrets | Vercel Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/settings/environment-variables`) with environment scoping |

### Environment Scoping on Vercel

Variables set in the Vercel Dashboard at `https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/settings/environment-variables` can be scoped to:

- **Production** — only `vercel.app` production deployments
- **Preview** — branch/PR deployments
- **Development** — `vercel dev` and `vercel env pull`

A variable can be assigned to one, two, or all three environments.

### Git Branch Overrides

Preview environment variables can be scoped to specific Git branches:

```bash
# Add a variable only for the "staging" branch
echo "staging-value" | vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview --git-branch=staging
```

## Common Gotchas

<!-- Sourced from env-vars skill: Gotchas -->
### `vercel env pull` Overwrites Custom Variables

`vercel env pull .env.local` **replaces the entire file** — any manually added variables (custom secrets, local overrides, debug flags) are lost. Always back up or re-add custom vars after pulling:

```bash
# Save custom vars before pulling
grep -v '^#' .env.local | grep -v '^VERCEL_\|^POSTGRES_\|^NEXT_PUBLIC_' > .env.custom.bak
vercel env pull .env.local --yes
cat .env.custom.bak >> .env.local  # Re-append custom vars
```

Or maintain custom vars in a separate `.env.development.local` file (loaded after `.env.local` by Next.js).

### Scripts Don't Auto-Load `.env.local`

Only Next.js auto-loads `.env.local`. Standalone scripts (`drizzle-kit`, `tsx`, custom Node scripts) need explicit loading:

```bash
# Use dotenv-cli
npm install -D dotenv-cli
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx drizzle-kit push
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx tsx scripts/seed.ts

# Or source manually
source <(grep -v '^#' .env.local | sed 's/^/export /') && node scripts/migrate.js
```

## Verification

After any mutation (`add` or `rm`), verify the change took effect:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

Re-list environment variables and confirm:

- For `add`: the new variable name appears in the expected environment(s).
- For `rm`: the variable name no longer appears in the target environment(s).

If verification fails (variable still present after remove, or missing after add), report the discrepancy and suggest retrying.

## Summary

Present a structured result block:

```
## Env Result
- **Action**: list | pull | add | remove | diff
- **Status**: success | failed
- **Variable**: <NAME> (for add/remove)
- **Environments**: production, preview, development (as applicable)
- **Details**: <key outcome>
```

For `diff`, include counts:

```
- **Local only**: N keys
- **Vercel only**: N keys
- **Shared**: N keys
```

## Next Steps

Based on the action performed:

- **After list** → "Run `/env pull` to sync to local, or `/env diff` to compare local vs Vercel."
- **After pull** → "Restart your dev server to pick up the new variables. Run `/env diff` to verify sync."
- **After add** → "Run `/deploy` to make the new variable available in your next deployment. For production, the variable is available immediately on the next request."
- **After remove** → "The variable is removed. If your app depends on it, update your code or add a replacement. Consider redeploying with `/deploy`."
- **After diff** → "Add missing variables with `/env add <NAME>`, or pull from Vercel with `/env pull` to sync."

### `marketplace`

Discover and install Vercel Marketplace integrations. Use to find databases, CMS, auth providers, and other services available on the Vercel Marketplace.

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Vercel Marketplace

Discover, install, and apply Vercel Marketplace integrations with guided setup and local verification.

## Preflight

1. **Project linked?** — Check for `.vercel/project.json` in the current directory or nearest parent.
   - If not found: run `vercel link` interactively, then re-run `/marketplace`.
   - Do not attempt provisioning until the project is linked.
2. **CLI available?** — Confirm `vercel` is on PATH.
   - If missing: `npm i -g vercel` (or `pnpm add -g vercel` / `bun add -g vercel`).
3. **Repo state** — Note uncommitted changes so the user can diff integration-related code changes later.
4. **Scope** — Detect monorepo (`turbo.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). If detected, confirm which package is targeted.

## Plan

The marketplace command follows an **apply-guide loop**:

1. **Discover** — Search the Marketplace catalog via `vercel integration discover`.
2. **Select** — User picks an integration (or specifies one in "$ARGUMENTS").
3. **Guide** — Fetch the agent-friendly setup guide via `vercel integration guide <name> --framework <fw>`.
4. **Install** — Run `vercel integration add <name>` for the automated happy path.
5. **Confirm env vars provisioned** — Explicitly verify required environment variables are set after provisioning.
6. **Apply code changes** — Install SDK packages and scaffold configuration code.
7. **Verify drain** — For observability integrations, confirm drain was auto-created and data is flowing.
8. **Run local health check** — Verify the integration works locally before deploying.

If "$ARGUMENTS" specifies an integration name, skip directly to the **Guide** step.

For observability integrations (Datadog, Sentry, Axiom, etc.), the flow extends with drain verification — see Step 7.

No destructive operations unless the user explicitly confirms. Package installs and code scaffolding are additive.

## Commands

### 1. Discover — Search the Marketplace Catalog

```bash
# Search all available integrations
vercel integration discover

# Filter by category
vercel integration discover --category databases
vercel integration discover --category monitoring
vercel integration discover --category auth

# List integrations already installed on this project
vercel integration list
```

Present integrations organized by category:

| Category   | Examples                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Database   | Neon, PlanetScale, Supabase       |
| Cache      | Upstash Redis, Upstash KV         |
| Auth       | Clerk, Auth0                      |
| CMS        | Sanity, Contentful, Prismic       |
| Payments   | Stripe, LemonSqueezy              |
| Monitoring | Datadog, Sentry, Axiom, Honeycomb |

Common replacements for sunset packages:

- **Neon** — Serverless Postgres (replaces `@vercel/postgres`)
- **Upstash** — Serverless Redis (replaces `@vercel/kv`)

### 2. Select — User Picks an Integration

If the user hasn't specified one in "$ARGUMENTS", ask which integration to set up. Accept the integration name or slug.

### 3. Guide — Fetch Setup Steps

```bash
# Get agent-friendly setup guide
vercel integration guide <name> --framework <fw>
```

Use framework-specific guides by default when framework is known. If unknown, infer from the repo and confirm with the user.

The guide returns structured setup steps: required env vars, SDK packages, code snippets, and framework-specific notes. Present these to the user.

### 4. Install — Add the Integration

```bash
vercel integration add <name>
```

`vercel integration add` is the primary scripted/AI flow. It installs against the linked project, auto-connects the integration, and auto-runs local env sync unless disabled.

If the CLI bounces to the dashboard for provider-specific completion, treat it as fallback and open the integration page directly:

```bash
vercel integration open <name>
```

Complete the web step, then continue with env verification.

After installation, the integration auto-provisions environment variables. For observability vendors (Datadog, Sentry, Axiom), this also auto-creates **log and trace drains**.

### 5. Confirm Env Vars Provisioned

Before applying code changes, verify the integration's required environment variables exist:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

Check that each variable name listed in the guide appears in the output. **Never echo variable values — check names only.**

- If local env sync was disabled or `.env.local` is stale, run:

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local --yes
```

- **All present** → Proceed to code changes.
- **Missing vars** → Tell the user which variables are missing. The integration install via `vercel integration add <name>` typically provisions these automatically. Guide the user to provision them before continuing.

### 6. Apply Code Changes

Install the SDK package:

```bash
npm install <sdk-package>   # or pnpm add / bun add
```

Then apply the code scaffolding from the guide:

- Create or update configuration files (e.g., `db.ts`, `redis.ts`, `auth.ts`)
- Add initialization code following the guide's patterns
- Respect the project's existing conventions (TypeScript vs JavaScript, import style, directory structure)

Ask the user for confirmation before writing files.

### 7. Verify Drain (Observability Integrations)

<!-- Sourced from marketplace skill: Observability Integration Path -->
Marketplace observability integrations (Datadog, Sentry, Axiom, Honeycomb, etc.) connect to Vercel's **Drains** system to receive telemetry. Understanding the data-type split is critical for correct setup.

### Data-Type Split

| Data Type          | Delivery Mechanism                                    | Integration Setup                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logs**           | Native drain (auto-configured by Marketplace install) | `vercel integration add <vendor>` auto-creates drain                                                                   |
| **Traces**         | Native drain (OpenTelemetry-compatible)               | Same — auto-configured on install                                                                                      |
| **Speed Insights** | Custom drain endpoint only                            | Requires manual drain creation via REST API or Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/dashboard/{team}/~/settings/log-drains`) |
| **Web Analytics**  | Custom drain endpoint only                            | Requires manual drain creation via REST API or Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/dashboard/{team}/~/settings/log-drains`) |

> **Key distinction:** When you install an observability vendor via the Marketplace, it auto-configures drains for **logs and traces** only. Speed Insights and Web Analytics data require a separate, manually configured drain pointing to a custom endpoint. See `⤳ skill: observability` for drain setup details.

### Agentic Flow: Observability Vendor Setup

Follow this sequence when setting up an observability integration:

#### 1. Pick Vendor

```bash
# Discover observability integrations
vercel integration discover --category monitoring

# Get setup guide for chosen vendor
vercel integration guide datadog
```

#### 2. Install Integration

```bash
# Install — auto-provisions env vars and creates log/trace drains
vercel integration add datadog
```

#### 3. Verify Drain Created

```bash
# Confirm drain was auto-configured
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v1/drains?teamId=$TEAM_ID" | jq '.[] | {id, url, type, sources}'
```

Check the response for a drain pointing to the vendor's ingestion endpoint. If no drain appears, the integration may need manual drain setup — see `⤳ skill: observability` for REST API drain creation.

#### 4. Validate Endpoint

```bash
# Send a test payload to the drain
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v1/drains/<drain-id>/test?teamId=$TEAM_ID"
```

Confirm the vendor dashboard shows the test event arriving.

#### 5. Smoke Log Check

```bash
# Trigger a deployment and check logs flow through
vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow --since 5m

# Check integration balance to confirm data is flowing
vercel integration balance datadog
```

Verify that logs appear both in Vercel's runtime logs and in the vendor's dashboard.

> **For drain payload formats and signature verification**, see `⤳ skill: observability` — the Drains section covers JSON/NDJSON schemas and `x-vercel-signature` HMAC-SHA1 verification.

### Speed Insights + Web Analytics Drains

For observability vendors that also want Speed Insights or Web Analytics data, configure a separate drain manually:

```bash
# Create a drain for Speed Insights + Web Analytics
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v1/drains?teamId=$TEAM_ID" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-vendor-endpoint.example.com/vercel-analytics",
    "type": "json",
    "sources": ["lambda"],
    "environments": ["production"]
  }'
```

> **Payload schema reference:** See `⤳ skill: observability` for Web Analytics drain payload formats (JSON array of `{type, url, referrer, timestamp, geo, device}` events).

- **Drain present** → Proceed to health check.
- **No drain found** → Integration may not auto-configure drains. Create one manually via Dashboard or REST API.
- **Drain errored** → Check the drain status in the Vercel Dashboard. Common fixes: endpoint URL typo, auth header missing, endpoint not accepting POST.

### 8. Run Local Health Check

Verify the integration works locally:

```bash
vercel dev
```

Or run the project's dev server and test the integration endpoint/connection:

- **Database** → Confirm connection by running a simple query (e.g., `SELECT 1`)
- **Auth** → Confirm the auth provider redirects correctly
- **Cache** → Confirm a set/get round-trip succeeds
- **CMS** → Confirm content fetch returns data
- **Observability** → Run `vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow --since 5m` and confirm logs appear in the vendor dashboard

If the health check fails, review the error output and guide the user through fixes (common: missing env vars in `.env.local`, wrong SDK version, network issues).

## Verification

After completing the apply-guide loop, confirm:

- [ ] Integration guide was retrieved via `vercel integration guide <name> --framework <fw>`
- [ ] Project was linked before provisioning started
- [ ] All required environment variables are provisioned on Vercel
- [ ] Local env sync is up to date (auto-sync succeeded or `vercel env pull .env.local --yes` ran)
- [ ] SDK package installed without errors
- [ ] Code changes applied and match the guide's patterns
- [ ] For observability integrations: drain verified and test payload received
- [ ] Local health check passed (dev server starts, integration responds)

If any step fails, report the specific error and suggest remediation before continuing.

## Summary

Present a structured result block:

```
## Marketplace Result
- **Integration**: <name>
- **Status**: installed | partially configured | failed
- **Package**: <sdk-package>@<version>
- **Env Vars**: <count> provisioned / <count> required
- **Drain**: configured | not applicable | manual setup needed
- **Health Check**: passed | failed | skipped
- **Files Changed**: <list of created/modified files>
```

## Next Steps

Based on the outcome:

- **Installed successfully** → "Run `/deploy` to deploy with the new integration. Your environment variables are already configured on Vercel."
- **Env vars missing** → "Provision the missing variables via the Vercel dashboard or `vercel integration add <name>`, then re-run `/marketplace <name>` to continue setup."
- **CLI handed off to dashboard** → "Run `vercel integration open <name>` to complete the provider web step, then resume from env verification."
- **Drain not auto-created** → "Create a drain manually via the REST API (`POST /v1/drains`) or the Dashboard."
- **Need Speed Insights / Web Analytics export** → "These data types require manual drain setup — they are not auto-configured by vendor installs. Configure via Dashboard or REST API."
- **Health check failed** → "Review the error above. Common fixes: copy env vars to `.env.local` with `vercel env pull`, check SDK version compatibility, verify network access."
- **Want another integration?** → "Run `/marketplace` again to browse available integrations."
- **Review changes** → "Run `git diff` to review all integration-related code changes before committing."

### `status`

Show the status of the current Vercel project — recent deployments, linked project info, and environment overview.

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

# Vercel Project Status (Doctor)

Comprehensive project health check. Diagnoses deployment state, environment configuration, domains, and build status.

## Preflight

1. Check for `.vercel/project.json` in the current directory (or nearest parent).
   - **If found**: read `projectId` and `orgId` to confirm linkage. Print project name.
   - **If not found**: print a clear message:
     > This project is not linked to Vercel. Run `vercel link` to connect it, then re-run `/status`.
     Stop here — remaining steps require a linked project. **Do NOT fall back to GitHub Actions (`gh run list`) or any other CI system.** The Vercel CLI is the only authoritative source for this command.
2. Verify `vercel` CLI is available on PATH. If missing, suggest `npm i -g vercel`.
3. Detect monorepo markers (`turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). If present, note which package scope is active.

## Plan

Gather project diagnostics using MCP reads where available, CLI as fallback:

1. Fetch recent deployments (last 5).
2. Inspect the latest deployment for build status and metadata.
3. List environment variables per environment (counts only — never print values).
4. Check domain configuration and status.
5. Read `vercel.json` for configuration highlights.

No destructive operations — this command is read-only.

## Commands

### 1. Recent Deployments

```
vercel ls
```

> **Note:** `vercel ls` does not support `--limit`. It returns recent deployments by default.

Extract: deployment URL, state (READY / ERROR / BUILDING), target (production / preview), created timestamp.

### 2. Latest Deployment Inspection

```
vercel inspect <latest-deployment-url>
```

Extract: build duration, function count, region, framework detected, Node.js version.

### 3. Environment Variable Counts

```
vercel env ls
```

Count variables per environment (Production, Preview, Development). **Never echo variable values.**

Present as:

| Environment | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Production  | N     |
| Preview     | N     |
| Development | N     |

### 4. Domain Status

```
vercel domains ls
```

For each domain: name, DNS configured (yes/no), SSL valid (yes/no).

### 5. Configuration Highlights

Read `vercel.json` (if present) and summarize:

- Framework preset
- Build command overrides
- Function configuration (runtime, memory, duration)
- Rewrites / redirects count
- Cron jobs defined
- Headers or middleware config

If `vercel.json` does not exist, note "No vercel.json found — using framework defaults."

### 6. Observability Diagnostics

Check the project's observability posture — drains, error monitoring, analytics instrumentation, and drain security.

#### 6a. Drains Configured?

Use MCP `list_drains` if available, or the REST API:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v1/drains?teamId=$TEAM_ID" | jq '.drains | length'
```

- **If drains exist**: list drain count, types (JSON/NDJSON/Syslog), and statuses.
- **If zero drains**: note "No drains configured" and flag as a gap for production observability.

#### 6b. Errored Drains?

For each drain returned, check the status field. If any drain shows an error or disabled state:

```
⚠️ Drain "<drain-url>" is in error state.
Remediation:
  1. Verify the endpoint URL is reachable and returns 2xx.
  2. Check that the endpoint accepts the configured format (JSON/NDJSON/Syslog).
  3. Test the drain: POST /v1/drains/<drain-id>/test
  4. If unrecoverable, delete and recreate the drain.
```

#### 6c. Analytics Instrumentation Present?

Scan the project source for `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` imports:

- Check `package.json` dependencies for `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights`.
- If missing either package, flag:
  > Analytics/Speed Insights not detected. Install `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` and add the components to your root layout.

#### 6d. Drain Signature Verification

Vercel signs every drain payload with an HMAC-SHA1 signature in the `x-vercel-signature` header. **Always verify signatures in production** to prevent spoofed data.

> **Critical:** You must verify against the **raw request body** (not a parsed/re-serialized version). JSON parsing and re-stringifying can change key order or whitespace, breaking the signature match.

```ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from 'crypto'

function verifyDrainSignature(rawBody: string, signature: string, secret: string): boolean {
  const expected = createHmac('sha1', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex')
  // Use timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
  if (expected.length !== signature.length) return false
  return timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(signature))
}
```

Usage in a drain endpoint:

```ts
// app/api/drain/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const rawBody = await req.text()
  const signature = req.headers.get('x-vercel-signature')
  const secret = process.env.DRAIN_SECRET!

  if (!signature || !verifyDrainSignature(rawBody, signature, secret)) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  const events = JSON.parse(rawBody)
  // Process verified events...
  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 })
}
```

> **Secret management:** The drain signing secret is shown once when you create the drain. Store it in an environment variable (e.g., `DRAIN_SECRET`). If lost, delete and recreate the drain.

Check whether the project has a `DRAIN_SECRET` env var set via `vercel env ls`. If drains are configured but no signature secret is found, flag as a security gap.

#### 6e. Fallback Guidance (No Drains)

If drains are unavailable (Hobby plan or not yet configured), use these alternatives:

| Need | Alternative | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| View runtime logs | **Vercel Dashboard** | `https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/deployments` → select deployment → Logs tab |
| Stream logs from terminal | **Vercel CLI** | `vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow` |
| Query logs programmatically | **MCP / REST API** | `get_runtime_logs` tool or `/v3/deployments/:id/events` |
| Monitor errors post-deploy | **CLI** | `vercel logs <url> --level error --since 1h` |
| Web Analytics data | **Dashboard only** | `https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/analytics` |
| Performance metrics | **Dashboard only** | `https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/speed-insights` |

> **Upgrade path:** When ready for centralized observability, upgrade to Pro and configure drains at `https://vercel.com/dashboard/{team}/~/settings/log-drains` or via REST API. The drain setup is typically < 5 minutes.

#### Observability Decision Matrix

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Page views, traffic sources | Web Analytics | First-party, privacy-friendly |
| Business event tracking | Web Analytics custom events | Track conversions, feature usage |
| Core Web Vitals monitoring | Speed Insights | Real user data per route |
| Function debugging | Runtime Logs (CLI `vercel logs` / Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/logs`) / REST) | Real-time, per-invocation logs |
| Export logs to external platform | Drains (JSON/NDJSON/Syslog) | Centralize observability (Pro+) |
| Export analytics data | Drains (Web Analytics type) | Warehouse pageviews + custom events (Pro+) |
| OpenTelemetry traces | Drains (OTel-compatible endpoint) | Standards-based distributed tracing (Pro+) |
| Post-response telemetry | `waitUntil` + custom reporting | Non-blocking metrics |
| Server-side event tracking | `@vercel/analytics/server` | Track API-triggered events |
| Hobby plan log access | CLI `vercel logs` + Dashboard (`https://vercel.com/{team}/{project}/logs`) | No drains needed |

## Verification

Confirm each data source returned successfully:

- [ ] Deployment list retrieved (count > 0 or "no deployments yet")
- [ ] Latest deployment inspected (or skipped if no deployments)
- [ ] Environment variable counts retrieved per environment
- [ ] Domain list retrieved (or "no custom domains")
- [ ] vercel.json parsed (or "not present")
- [ ] Drain status checked (count, errored drains identified)
- [ ] Analytics/Speed Insights instrumentation detected (or gap flagged)
- [ ] Drain signature secret checked (if drains configured)

If any check fails, report the specific error and continue with remaining checks.

## Summary

Present the diagnostic report:

```
## Vercel Doctor — Project Status

**Project**: <name> (<org>)
**Latest Deployment**: <url> — <state> (<target>, <timestamp>)
**Build**: <duration>, <framework>, Node <version>

### Deployments (last 5)

| Speed Insights (`@vercel/speed-insights`) | ✓ installed / ✗ not found |
| Drain signature secret | ✓ DRAIN_SECRET set / ⚠ missing |
```

## Next Steps

Based on the diagnostic results, suggest relevant actions:

- **Build errors** → "Run `/deploy` to trigger a fresh build, or check `vercel logs <url>` for details."
- **Missing env vars** → "Run `/env list` to review, or `/env pull` to sync locally."
- **DNS not configured** → "Update your domain DNS records. See the Vercel domains dashboard."
- **No deployments** → "Run `/deploy` to create your first deployment."
- **Stale deployment** → "Your latest deployment is over 7 days old. Consider redeploying."
- **No vercel.json** → "Add a `vercel.json` if you need custom build, function, or routing configuration."
- **No drains (Hobby)** → "View logs via Dashboard or `vercel logs <url> --follow`. Upgrade to Pro for drain-based forwarding."
- **No drains (Pro+)** → "Configure drains for centralized observability via Dashboard or REST API."
- **Errored drain** → "Test the endpoint: `POST /v1/drains/<id>/test`. Check URL reachability and format compatibility."
- **Missing analytics** → "Install `@vercel/analytics` and add `<Analytics />` to your root layout."
- **Missing speed insights** → "Install `@vercel/speed-insights` and add `<SpeedInsights />` to your root layout."
- **Missing drain secret** → "Set `DRAIN_SECRET` env var. Without it, drain endpoints can't verify payload authenticity."
